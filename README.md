My bootstrap project -

-- bare bones due to time constraints
-- not real clear about the classes and how they interact 

In any case, it's a loose resemblance to my wireframes.

1. Files included:

admin.html
user.html
TeslaChart.png
qrcode.svg
user-128.svg
README.md

2. Files that are in the repository but not used:

index.html was a temporary file we used in class.

user.css and admin.css are included but not used.  Wishful thinking.  Sigh.

wireframes the html pages are based on (Admin Page v01.png and User Page v01.png) are in the images directory also.
